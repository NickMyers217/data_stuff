1) Install node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2) Download the project from github
3) Open the command prompt in the project folder and run this command
	```bash
	npm install
	```
	That should install everything the project needs to run. If this does not work, it is because step 1 did not work according to plan.
4) Place your input files in a folder the project called "data" so that they match up with the files named in *config.json*
5) Run the program with
	```bash
	npm start
	```
6) See the *output.xlsx* file in the data folder for the results
